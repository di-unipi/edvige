Hi there!

I am **Edvige**, the freeshnew monthly newsletter of the UNIPI Computer Science Department. I‚Äôll collect news, events and curiosity about our department and I am just the starting point of a bigger communication iniziative of our Department.

***Why a newsletter? Don't we receive enough e-mails already?***<br/>
This is the point! We receive too many communications and, as a result, most of them get buried! Therefore, it is essential to organise in one place all the most important news concerning the Department activities. My goal is allowing you to search ‚ÄúEdvige‚Äù in your email and get in one click all the info you need! 

Internal communication and exchange is the starting point for growing awareness about the role and positioning of our department and a mandatory step for the building of a proper external communication strategy. This is why there‚Äôs also an [Edvige‚Äôs form](https://forms.gle/QjRuQ12iqabMtU2F8) for the collection of News and Events to be promoted on the monthly communication newsletter. The form is accessible only with institutional addresses (i.e., @studenti.unipi.it, @phd.unipi.it, @unipi.it). Tell me what you are doing and I‚Äôll do the rest!
